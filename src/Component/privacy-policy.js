                                    This is a summary of our new privacy policy which takes effect on May 25th, 2018.
                                    It covers every GIKS website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites.
                                    The detailed policy follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.
                                    Our privacy commitment: GIKS has never sold your information to someone else for advertising,
                                    or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will. This has been our approach for almost 5 years,
                                    and we remain committed to it. This policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it,
                                    and what you can do about it.

                                    When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify one or more administrators.
                                    The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account.
                                    If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator
                                    role for your organization. Make sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions
                                    as an administrator of your organization account. You are responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of your organization account password,
                                    ii) appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization account, and iii)
                                    ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your organization account comply with this Agreement.
                                    You understand that GIKS is not responsible for account administration and internal management of the Services for you.
                                    You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose control of the administrator accounts.
                                    You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email
                                    to info@giksindia.com provided that the process is acceptable to GIKS. In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process,
                                    GIKS may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to GIKS demonstrating authorization to act on
                                    behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold GIKS liable for the consequences of any action taken by GIKS in good faith in this regard.

                                    We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account,
                                    register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information,
                                    but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).
                                    When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site,
                                    where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to
                                    drive new product development. Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral
                                    programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google,
                                    they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our
                                    brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions
                                    and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.

                                    activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests,
                                    new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user
                                    needs and to improve our websites and services. We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information.
                                    In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case,
                                    we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests. You can decline certain kinds of
                                    information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to
                                    prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable
                                    third-party cookies from all GIKS websites and products. We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who
                                    have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars,
                                    and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.
                                    The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing,
                                    data portability, and the right to object and to complain). GIKS undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.
                                    We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
                                    When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is
                                    appropriate.

                                    If you handle other people's data using GIKS apps, such as information about your customers or employees,
                                    you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use a GIKS mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library,
                                    you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data. You own your service data. We protect it,
                                    limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations,
                                    and request that we export or delete it. We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use GIKS Services. After you terminate your account,
                                    your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that. If you are in the European

                                    you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data.
                                    To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.

                                    There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation,
                                    prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers;
                                    when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it. Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy
                                    policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties. You can always contact us to:
                                    ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from
                                    a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums.
                                    we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.

                                    This Privacy Policy statement is made by the GIKS Group consisting of all the entities listed (collectively,
                                    "GIKS", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 25th May 2018.
                                    It applies to all our divisions: GIKS India, GIKS Canada and GIKS Singapore.

                                <p className="common-para">
                                    GIKS has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct,
                                    or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential
                                    for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific
                                    engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free
                                    editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue,
                                    and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings. The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers
                                    and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the
                                    relevant cases.
                                    We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.

                                    Information provided in connection with services : You may entrust information that you or your organization (“you”) control, to GIKS in connection with use of our services or for requesting technical support for our products. This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor). The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services. Information from mobile devices : When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device. Our applications require such access to provide their services. Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders. This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations. You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device. The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).

                                    to data that you knowingly share with us for technical support or to import data into our products or services. We communicate our

                                    other users : Some of our products or services allow you to collaborate with other users or third parties. Initiating collaboration
                                    may enable other collaborators to view some or all of your profile information. For example, when you edit a document that you have
                                    shared with other persons for collaboration, your name and profile picture will be displayed next to your edits to allow your

Third-party integrations you have enabled : Most of our products and services support integrations with third-party products and services. If you choose to enable any third-party integrations, you may be allowing the third party to access your service information and personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the third-party services and products before you enable integrations with them. Other cases : Other scenarios in which we may share information that are common to information covered under Parts I and II are described in Part III.
