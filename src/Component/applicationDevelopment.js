                    An Agile software development methodology that emphasizes fast-paced and iterative development cycles. 
                    Rapid Application Development aims to deliver high-quality software solutions quickly by prioritizing user feedback, 
                    collaboration, and iterative prototyping. In Rapid Application Development process focuses on rapid prototyping, allowing stakeholders to visualize and interact with the application early on. RAD enables faster development, reduces time-to-market, and promotes flexibility for changes and enhancements.

                    RAD can significantly reduce the time it takes to develop an application. This is because RAD focuses on iterative development, which means that the application is built in small increments and tested frequently. This helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, which can save time and money in the long run.
